         <p>... Other two men were convicted of supplying arms to the Fenians and conspiring to levy war against the Queen. The were sentenced to different terms of imprisonment; but we need scarcely refer to the suggestion of Mr. Parnell that one of these men, being an Englishman, probably received a more merciful sentence than the other, who was an Irishman. It is really melancholy to find Irish members of Parliament of any party disgracing themselves and their country by making such unfounded insinuations in the face of the world...</p>
         <p>... Mr. Parnell, it appears, threatens to go to Balmoral, claim his right to a personal interview with her Majesty, and force the petitions in favour of the release of the Fenian prisoners on the attention of the Queen. He had better not. This would be carrying the undoubted privilege of a member of Parliament much too far. Even at Balmoral there are several policemen, into whose charge Mr. Parnell would undoubtedly be given. The cause of an amnesty has not made very much way by the unseemly display of the Home Rulers last Monday night in the House of Commons.</p>
