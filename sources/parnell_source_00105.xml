         <p>Mr. Parnell assured them that he came there anxious and determined if possible to act in the spirit indicated by the very rev. gentleman, but at the very outset they found themselves, he regretted to say, in a difficulty about the minutes. They were imperfect, inasmuch as they did not contain a report of the proceedings that took place after his lordship left the chair.</p>
         <p>Professor Kavanagh - I deny it, sir (cries of "order, order.")</p>
         <p>Mr. Parnell - Your lordship, in your letter to the papers gave as one of the reasons that I was not qualified to act as chairman, that I was not a subscriber. I subscribed to the bakers of Navan, and I subscribed to the Drogheda band for uniforms to enable them to appear respectably in the procession; and I subscribed to the Amnesty Association in Dublin (hear, hear). I subscribed to these three bodies. I utterly deny that you can alter the constitution of the committee as defined by the Conference, any more than the President of the United States could alter the constitution of that amnesty or Queen Victoria could alter the British Constitution (hear, hear). Mr. Parnell condemned the conduct of the Lord Mayor on leaving the chair, and as to his own eligibility, said he had attended there without being objected to on two previous occasions, and had then exercised the privilege of speaking. They wanted to settle these matters quietly, but they had a duty to perform. They must see that the money was spent legally and properly, and in accordance with the wishes of the country (hear, hear).</p>
