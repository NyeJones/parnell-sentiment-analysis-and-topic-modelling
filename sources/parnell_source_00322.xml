         <p>Mr. Parnell said he looked forward to the future with a light heart, for he was convinced that five hundred thousand Irishmen enfranchised by the new Act would be even truer to Ireland than those who went before them. Having briefly touched on the land and labour question, he referred to that of Irish independence, and said:-</p>
         <p>We cannot ask for less than the restitution of Grattan's Parliament with its important privileges, and wide and far-reaching constitution. We cannot under the British Constitution ask for more than the restitution of Grattan's Parliament. But no man has the right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation. No man has a right to say to his country, "Thus far shalt thou go, and no further," and we have never attempted to fix the ne plus ultra [italics] to the progress of Ireland's nationhood, and we never shall. While we leave these things to time, circumstance, and the future we must, each one of us, resolve in our own hearts that we shall at all times do everything which within us lies to obtain for Ireland the fullest measure of her rights. In this way we shall avoid difficulties and contentions among each other. In this way we shall not give up anything which the future may put in favour of our country, and while we struggle today with the proud consciousness that we shall not do anything  to hinder or prevent better men who may come after us from gaining better things than those for which we now contend.</p>
