         <p>â€¦ At 3 o'clock Mr. Parnell was conducted into the Board Room, and formally introduced to the assembled brokers. Some cheered and others hissed him. He said:</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the Stock Exchange: I have been permitted by the kindness of your President to address you a few words for the purpose of enlisting your sympathy in aid of the famine-stricken Irish. I feel that I ought not to leave New-York without availing myself of the official recognition afforded by your courtesy. I shall not make any reference to political matters, as that would be entirely out of place, and would be an abuse of the privilege accorded me. The distress in Ireland is very great. Hundreds of thousands at the present moment know not where to look for the next meal, and unless prompt aid is rendered we shall see a renewal of the scenes of 1847 and 1848. I am sure that it is unnecessary for me to mention more than these facts, and I leave the rest to the acknowledged and well-known liberality of the members of this Exchange. My visit to you has given me much gratification, as I have had the opportunity of witnessing what may be called one of the wonders of America, and one not the less wonderful because it is artificial and not natural. I thank you for your courtesy and kindness in giving me so patient a hearing, and I now leave the matter in your hands. </p>
