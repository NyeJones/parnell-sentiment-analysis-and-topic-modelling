         <p>The other question was one put by Mr. Parnell, who received his inspiration from a different source. Poor Mr. Parnell is experiencing some of the discomforts which belong to the position of a county member returned by clerical influence. There are certain unpleasant duties which such a representative is obliged to fulfil, and Mr. Parnell cannot, if he would, escape from the ordeal. He was unhappy in his subject, and failed egregiously; but he has done what was required of him, and his new constituents are bound, in fairness, to be satisfied. He had the indiscretion, to say the least, to insinuate that a certain letter of a reverend gentleman to the commanding officer of the Meath Militia, and from which Mr. Hardy quoted a passage on a previous occasion, was not forthcoming. This was an imputation on the candour of the Minister of War and he repelled it with becoming spirit. Mr. Parnell wished to postpone his question, but Mr. Hardy insisted upon answering it at once, and he showed very clearly that Mr. Parnell's informants had led him into an awkward dilemma. The embarrassment which he intended for the minister recoiled upon himself, and he felt it necessary to offer a personal explanation, disolving [sic] the imputation. He marred the grace of it, however, by attempting to impute motives to Mr. Hardy, but was stopped by the Speaker, and declared out of order.</p>
