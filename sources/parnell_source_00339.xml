         <p>In the opening, Parnell apologized for the absence of Dillon, and stated that he was </p>
         <p>Called Suddenly to New York</p>
         <p>to attend to business that called them to this country and his mission was of a twofold nature. First, to contend against the present great calamity and send assistance to a quarter of a million of starving countrymen. Second, to help to break down the terrible system which was the cause of all this distress. When they left home England would not acknowledge that there was distress in Ireland, but public opinion has been so stirred up that she was forced to acknowledge it. He then spoke of the help America was always ready to extend to Ireland, especially in time of trouble, and said that the New York bankers told him that remittances to Ireland had doubled the usual amount during the past six weeks. In speaking of the distress he stated that in seven counties in Ireland in the west and south the feeling was as bad as in 1845. In these counties there were a hundred thousand men, half of whom would be out of bread in a fortnight. It would be impossible to help all, consequently those in most distress must be helped first. When speaking in Ireland he had advised the tenants to keep their money to pay the merchant's bill, so that their credit might be good, to purchase food when famine came. In 1845 there were not the advantages that can now be used to ward off famine. It took a long time for food to travel. They can now telegraph money which is a thing needed, as there is food enough if there was money to buy it in five seconds, and then do a great work by saving many lives. He then discussed the land system and the Prussian system, and said the rents should come down twenty-five per cent., and the valuation of the land from $350,000,000 to $1[X]0,000,000. He took up Lord Dunraven's letter in one of the New York papers and criticized it sharply and at some length. He said that Dunraven did not know so much as Cavanaugh.
