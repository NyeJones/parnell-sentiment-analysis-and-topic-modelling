         <p>Mr. Parnell drew attention to the facts of the case of Daniel Reddin, who at the close of the Fenian troubles was sentenced to five years' penal servitude. In consequence of the hardships inflicted upon the man he was seized with paralysis, and the prison officials, acting upon the assumption that he was malingering, applied and thrust sharp instruments into the muscles of his legs. In addition to this, they, in the winter-time, put him naked into a cell, and when he was physically unable to take exercise in the prison yard, caused him to be dragged to and fro, first by convicts and afterwards by warders. Finally, he fell from a height when endeavouring to shield a fellow-convict who had done for him work which he was unable to accomplish, and was then discharged from prison. He afterwards took steps to obtain redress in a court of law, but on the medical officers making affidavits to the effect that they had simply applied to the man the tests usual in cases where it was suspected that paralysis was assumed and not real, the Judge of the Court stopped proceedings, and the man altogether failed to obtain the redress he sought. This was a gross case, and he hoped that if Parliament did not take up the case English public opinion would be clearly expressed concerning it. (Hear, hear.)</p>
