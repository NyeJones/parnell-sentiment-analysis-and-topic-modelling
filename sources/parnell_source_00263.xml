         <p>Mr. Parnell has gone to Galway "in person." There has been immense excitement. But the "uncrowned king" has put the point at issue in its real aspect. It was not, after all, "a question of Lynch or O'Shea; it was a question to be decided by the leader of the Irish people." So Mr. Lynch thought it over, and eventually declared that "rather than divide the party he would retire." Magnanimous Mr. Lynch! The Captain will have a walk-over, and the accommodating go-between of Kilmainham Treaty notoriety will once more be ready to render his mediatory offices in case the existing compact between Parnell and Gladstone should require patching up. Until it dawned upon the minds of Galway boys that the question was not "a question of Lynch or O'Shea" matters wore a very menacing aspect indeed. The violent Healy and the cynical Biggar were in open rebellion against the dictatorship of "Charlie." A furious mob wished the latter, together with the O'Shea, in a place the intense heat of which surpasses anything of which the Connaught people can have experience on this side of the grave. Even local opinion was notoriously divided; and we read of a clerical gentleman attempting to push his umbrella into a Town Commissioner's mouth for shouting in favour of Lynch. Certainly, Galway Town Commissioners are not infrequently highly favoured in the shape of "capacious mouths," but, then, Irish priests often carry huge umbrellas, especially in the neighbourhood under notice, which is a "wet" place, even for the Green Isle. No wonder, then, if the Municipal dignitary refused to swallow the clerical "gamp," and continued to shout for Lynch, until "Charlie" made it plain that "it was not a question of Lynch or O'Shea; it was a question to be decided by the leader of the Irish people." That leader he is, and the master of our Radical Prime Minister also. But for how long? Until the moment when Mr. Gladstone attempts to fulfill his bargain with Mr. Parnell. Then the Radical Premiership will disappear; then, too, the Lynches and the O'Sheas will have another chance of "going" for one another, and the "uncrowned king" may discover, as he has nearly done this week, that</p>
         <p>Those who in quarrels interpose</p>
         <p>Must often wipe a bloody nose - </p>
         <p>Especially in Galway, sir.</p>
