         <p>Dear Sir - While I am bound to acknowledge the general accuracy of your Parliamentary reports, I must ask you to allow me to correct an error which, through the mistaken insertion of the little word not [italics], appears in your report of the remarks I made on the question of the adjournment of the debate, moved on Thursday night by Mr. Parnell. You say that I appealed to my honourable friend not [italics] to press his motion for adjournment. The contrary is the fact. I believed that Mr. Parnell's action in moving the adjournment was the only fitting reply that could be given to the noisy gentlemen on the Tory benches, who, by their conduct, clearly intimated that they came there to shout and not to argue; and I, therefore, urged him to press the motion for adjournment, which I am glad to say he had the pluck to do. I am particularly anxious to be set right in this matter, because I am sensitive to the honour of the party with which I am allowed to act in the House of Commons; and I do not wish to appear as having advised a course tending manifestly to its humiliation. When a member insisting on his right to be heard resolves to punish unreasonable interruption, and makes his motion for adjournment accordingly, and then suffers himself to be moved from his purpose by a sudden outflow of blandishments from the Treasury bench, or by the suggestions of some too conciliatory friend, who has, perhaps, only come upon the scene at the last moment, and knows nothing of the merits of the question at issue, he pursues a course which is both impolitic and inglorious. I am not as ready to make a declaration of hostility to the house as some of my friends. I believe there is great wisdom at times in reserving one's strength; but when the necessity of a hostile declaration is clear, it ought to be made, and maintained, regardless of threat or cajolery.</p>
