         <!--put exact source text here in new <p></p> tags for each paragraph e.g. <p>Mr Parnell addresed the crowd [etc]</p>-->
         <p>Mr. Biggar by his injudicious and offensive remarks, after the Prime Minister had declared the intention of the Government, together with the remarks of his bosom friend, Mr. Parnell, M.P., have done frightful damage to these misguided men, who are now suffering in durance vile for the acts they have perpetrated. These two sagacious senators have simply damaged the whole business confided to them; and as long as such unjustifiable and gross outburts [sic] of wrath and threats are heard in the House, it is utterly idle to expect that her Majesty will be advised to pardon any more of them than those already released, which she graciously did under the advice of Mr. Gladstone when last in office.</p>
         <p>It appears 138 members of Parliament signed the memorial presented to the Prime Minister praying for the release, but it is pretty clear, from the strong disavowals of so many honourable members, that they did so sign under an entire misapprehension of the real object to be accomplished, and that considerable pressure must have been brought to bear upon them - as Mr. Brooks (who put the question to the Prime Minister) courageously stated, that had he known or even expected the statements which Messrs. Biggar and Parnell had thought fit to make, he should not have interfered at all in the matter.</p>
