         <p>Addressing a meeting of the electors of Cork last night, Mr. Parnell, M.P., referred to the extension of the franchise in Ireland, and said that he looked forward to the future with a light heart, for he was convinced that the 500,000 Irishmen who within a year must vote for the men of their choice would be as true to Ireland - even truer - than those who had gone before them, and he was assured that they might safely be trusted with the exercise of the great and important privilege, unequalled in its magnitude in the history of any nation. When the reckoning up came, after the general election in 1886, they in Ireland would have cause to congratulate themselves upon the position of a strong party, who would break down all opposition, and, with the country behind them, gain for the people those rights which were stolen from them. They would struggle, as before, for the important interests of the Irish tenant farmers, and they would ask that his industry should not be fettered by rent. They would ask from the farmers in return that they shall encourage the struggling manufacturers of Ireland. They would also endeavour to secure for the labourer some recognition and a right in the land of his own country, and whatever class obstructed this it would have to be put down, coerced if they wished it, into doing justice to the labourer. It was impossible to say how far justice would be done under the British Constitution, but they could not ask less than the restitution of Grattan's Parliament and its important privileges. No man had the right to say to his country, "Thus far shalt thou go and no farther" and they had never attempted to fix the ne plus ultra [italics] of the progress of Ireland's nationhood. But while they left these things to time, circumstances, and the future, they should all resolve in their own hearts that they would at all times do whatever within them lay to obtain for Ireland the fullest measure of her rights.</p>
