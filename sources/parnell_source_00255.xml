         <p>Mr. Parnell has, so he says, "closed the book" which tells the story of the city of Galway election. If he could for ever shut the volume which will, some day, be written about the causes which led to his political decay and fall, he would be happier than he is to-day. That book, however, is still open. Mr. Lynch, in obeying the commands of the dictator, has for the moment closed the chapter which will tell how the germs of the anti-Parnellite rebellion broke out in Galway. How many more chapters, describing similar incidents, remain to be written? The answer to this question depends upon the number of Lynches who are likely to put themselves forward as candidates for Irish Nationalistic seats. There are plenty of them, and Mr. Parnell will have his hands more than full if he tries to suppress all the revolts which from this time forward will be made against his dictatorship. From his own account, he seems to have taken a specially friendly interest in the career of his former foe and present friend, Captain O'Shea, whom he now receives into the fold as an errant but repentant lamb. Even Mr. Parnell's powers, however, are not sufficient to enable him to take such a fraternal care of every Irish member who feels inclined to dispute his authority. Mr. Gladstone would do well to take note of the incidents of the Galway election. It means that he will have to pay much higher terms for Mr. Parnell's alliance than if Mr. Parnell were the only Irishman to be reckoned with. What the member for Cork will be worth when he is bought is another question, which the Premier will have to decide before he absolutely confirms the contract.</p>
