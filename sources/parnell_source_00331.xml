         <p>New York, Jan. 22. - A World's cable from Cork yesterday says: â€¦ Parnell dined with the Mayor, who presided, and afterwards went to the Opera House, which could not possibly hold one-tenth of the pressing masses. Two hundred of the principal citizens were seated on the stage, and were backed up by a splendid gas device - a harp and shamrock, surmounted by the monogram "C.P." When Parnell arose before the standing and cheering audience, among which were hundreds of ladies, he looked pale and weary, having travelled continuously from London after three days of illness there; but his voice did not break in the speech which he made. He was introduced by the Mayor, and the whole audience sang "God Save Ireland." Then came resolutions of confidence in Parnell, his Parliamentary administration, and the action of the gallant band he leads in the House of Commons. The resolutions pledged the people of Cork to support the Irish National League.</p>
         <p>Parnell's peroration was the history of his movements since he was elected Member for Cork, five years ago, from which history he deduced the conclusion that it was not possible for the English parties to much longer resist the determined band of Irishmen backed by Irish people, who "in the near future will prove invincible and unconquerable." The emphasis with which this was uttered was received with immense cheering. His exordium was, "What of Home Rule? It was stolen from Ireland and must be restored; and that must include the restitution of Grattan's Parliament, with its important privileges and far-reaching constitution. Yet no man has the right to limit the boundary of the march of a nation. Let us combine together! Let factions die! Who can say that we shall not then gather richer fruit than we now aim to pluck?" The speech was short but pointed, and the cry was caught up by the thousands outside: "Grattan's Parliament." Under this shibboleth the streets and public houses re-echoed tell midnight, and it is believed here that this will become the new cry.</p>
