         <p>Mr. Parnell said - On Friday last, when this vote was passing, he asked the Chief Secretary a question respecting the appointment of Mr. Sheridan as Clerk of Petty Sessions for the county of Meath, which was annulled by the authorities of Dublin Castle. Mr. Sheridan was elected by five votes to three on the part of Mr. Darling, his opponent. The return was forwarded to the Castle and an objection was taken to the appointment of Mr. Sheridan by the defeated candidate. After the Castle had inquired into the matter, a delay of six or seven weeks occurred, and they came to the conclusion to annul the election of Mr. Sheridan, and to appoint Mr. Darling in his place. He found by the Act that only magistrates residing in the district or attending petty sessions were entitled to vote at such elections; but on this occasion one stipendiary magistrate voted, which was to be regretted, for he was glad to say the stipendiary magistrates were not in the habit of voting at these elections. He could not find any section in any of the Acts bearing on the subject allowing the Castle to appoint candidates to these situations, although he had always understood that the power was vested in the magistrates and the Lord Lieutenant jointly of dismissing a man. He thought a great hardship had been done in this case to an individual, a great slight put upon the gentry of the locality, and an obnoxious precedent set to parties in Meath who sought to make religious questions of these appointments. He hoped the Chief Secretary would institute an inquiry into all the circumstances of the case, and have evidence adduced on both sides.</p>
