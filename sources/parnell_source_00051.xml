         <p>Mr Parnell had the following notice upon the paper - to ask the Secretary of War if he has any objection to say whether the letter from the Rev. H. Behan to Sir John Dillon, to which he referred in answer to a previous question, as containing a demand that Sir John Dillon would send the Meath Militia Regiment to Mass on the 6th and 27th of May, is in existence, and if not, when, and under what circumstances it ceased to exist; whether there was not a subsequent letter from the Rev. H. Behan to Sir John Dillon containing a request that he would allow the men to attend Mass on the 27th of May; and whether it is a fact that the Tipperary and Westmeath Regiments of Militia are allowed by their commanding officers to attend Mass on holidays; and whether he would direct that same facilities should be given in future by the commanding officer of the Meath Militia to enable his men to do the same! The hon. member said he would postpone the question until Tuesday, as he intended to ask further if the right hon. gentleman was aware that the Meath Militia was quartered in barracks on the 22nd of May, and was not allowed out of barracks.</p>
         <p>...</p>
         <p>Mr. Parnell - May I ask the right hon. gentleman if he proposes to take any further steps in reference to the matter?</p>
         <p>...</p>
         <p>Mr. Parnell again rose amid cries of "order." He said - I wish to make a personal explanation. The right hon. gentleman seems to be under the impression that by my question, of which I gave him due notice, I wished to convey some imputation upon him. I wish distinctly to disclaim any such wish, or that I desired to cast any imputation of any kind whatever upon the right hon. gentleman will observe that if I do not wish to make any imputation upon him he appeared to me by his answers to my question - - (cries of "order.")</p>
