         <p>Mr Parnell addressed several meetings in Galway yesterday in support of the candidature of Captain O'Shea for the city. In addressing a large meeting in Eyre Square from the steps of the Railway Hotel, he said the circumstances of the present contest had been well calculated to try the devotion and spirit of union of the people of Galway and it was a remarkable fact that they should have stood the test. He admired the spirit with which Mr Lynch had entered into his candidature, and the feelings he had exhibited in withdrawing. Had he known a few days sooner of Mr Lynch's desire to represent the constituency he would have cheerfully yielded, but he had been informed Mr Lynch would not come forward, and he therefore chose Captain O'Shea, whom he could not now reject, as he had supported him (Mr Parnell) in his claim to the Irish leadership in 1880. He had since condemned Mr O'Shea publicly for not sitting with the Irish party, but Mr O'Shea had now given his promise to sit on their side of the House. He (Mr Parnell) had never misled the Irish people, and would never do so to that time when he would gain for them the right to lead and govern themselves.</p>
