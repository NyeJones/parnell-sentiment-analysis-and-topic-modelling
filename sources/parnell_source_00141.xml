         <p>This over, the next point in the questions which really stirred the house was the first query advanced by Mr. Parnell with regard to the prisoner Condon. There were two queries relating to the case of the unfortunate man - one directed to Mr. Bourke and the other directed to Mr. Cross - and it would be impossible to find a greater contrast than was supplied by the answers to these two questions, put in an admirable and dignified manner by Mr. Parnell. Mr. Bourke was courteous and explicit and commanded the approval of the entire house. The dapper Home Secretary, who, especially when there is a question to be answered, assumes a smirk of a by no means pleasing nature, was pert and obviously inclined to snub the questioner. Appearing at the table, like a Jack-in-the-box suddenly released, he peppered Mr. Parnell with point-blank contradictions, all the time the smirk gradually developing into a more shapely grin. "Somebody," in fact he suggested, if he did not absolutely say, "has been humbugging the hon. members - he found a mare's nest." Of course there was the usual burst of laughter from behind Mr. Cross, who is now regarded as the rising "funny man" of the Cabinet since poor Mr. Cavendish Bentinck has given up the business.</p>
