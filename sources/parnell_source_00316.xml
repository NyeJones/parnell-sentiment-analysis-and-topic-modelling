         <p>Mr. Parnell's address to his constituents at Cork last night was of the kind that might have been anticipated. His professions of confident hope for the success of Irish Nationalism are increased by the passing of the Franchise Act. He counts upon the support of the whole of the newly-enfranchised Irishmen, and is apparently willing to bid for that support even at the expense of the tenant-farmers. The Nationalists, he declared, did not care whether it was the farmer or the landlord that stood in the way of the agricultural labourer; they considered that whatever class attempted to obstruct the labourer in the possession of those fair and just rights to which he was entitled, that class should be coerced into doing justice to the labourer. So that apparently Mr. Parnell would coerce the landlords into doing justice to the tenants, and then, when the labourers get political power, he would coerce the tenants into doing justice to the labourers. Mr. Parnell declared that the Nationalists could not ask for less than the restitution of Grattan's Parliament, and he added that they could scarcely, under the Constitution, ask for more. But no man, he said, had a right to fix a boundary to the march of a nation. This magniloquent declamation naturally roused the greatest enthusiasm in his audience, who doubtless apprehended its full meaning. But Mr. Parnell may be reckoning without his host. In spite of perfervid oratory, Irish farmers and the newly-enfranchised labourers may elect to be independent both of his coercion and patronage.</p>
