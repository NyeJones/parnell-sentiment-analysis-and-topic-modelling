         <p>The Cork speech of Mr. Parnell is thus paraphrased and commented on by the Times [italics]:- "First, the farmer is to pay no rent. The Land Act, and the judicial rents that have been fixed for fifteen years, are to go where other Land Acts have gone before - into the limbo of obsolete attempts to settle the Irish question. Secondly, there is to be protection for Irish industry, and the farmer, being relieved of the necessity of paying anything to his landlord, is to be asked - and no doubt 'put down and coerced' if he refuses - to pay a good deal more than he need for his plough, his coat, and his farm-fittings. Thus Irish manufactures are to be bolstered up at the expense of the Irish farmer and labourer. Sir Stafford Northcote confesses to a little hankering after what is called reciprocity in matters of trade; how would Mr. Parnell like it if reciprocity were tried between England and Ireland, and if his movement for boycotting English cottons and hardware were answered on this side in the direction of boycotting Irish cattle and butter? The third plank in the Parnellite platform is to be the elevation of the labourer - of that waif and stray who was ignored in the days of the Land League, but who now, when his vote will count as much as his master's, must be flattered and courted in his turn. The labourer is to have his bit of the land - rent free, of course; and woe to the farmer or the landlord whose 'prejudices stand in his way. Farmer and landlord in such a case must each be 'put down and coerced.' Lastly, there comes the question of the 'rights which were stolen' from Ireland; which, as Mr. Parnell goes on to explain, means the right to a Parliament on College Green. He declines to forecast the future so far as to state either by what means this restitution will be brought about, or the extent to which the 'rights' are to go; but his hints are tolerably clear. Ireland, he says, cannot be content with less than Grattan's Parliament; while under the British Constitution more could not be asked for."</p>
