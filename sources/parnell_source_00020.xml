         <p>Mr Parnell said that the member for the county Derry (Mr. R. Smyth) had said coercive measures were necessary to prevent Protestants and Roman Catholics flying at each other's throats; but he would ask if that was any reason why thirty other counties should have coercive measures fixed upon them (hear, hear). In these discussions they always heard a great deal about exercising the rights of property, but they heard very little of the duties of those who hold property. He had seen landlords sitting in polling booths watching the way in which illiterate electors recorded their votes; but he thought that could scarcely be considered either one of the rights or duties of landlords (hear, hear). He considered, with Ireland in a state of perfect quietness, it was scarcely the time when a Government ought to come forward with a bill of this kind. He did not believe that the farmers even of the Black North were so sunk in their own selfish interests as to give up the interests of their country for that of their class. He claimed for the people of Ireland the right of self-government, the right that every people had naturally - the right of governing their country according to their own will. That was all they wanted. This had been a part of the tradition of England in the past, the tradition by which she came to her present greatness, and by which he hoped she would become greater in the future (hear, hear). He complained of Ireland being treated as a geographical fragment, and, in conclusion, proclaimed that it was the desire of Ireland, notwithstanding the manner in which she was treated, to be with England, and to defend her when her hour of trouble came.</p>
