         <p>Mr. Parnell, High Sheriff, county Wicklow, said he seconded the admission of the gentlemen named with very great pleasure. He had also much pleasure in identifying himself with that league (hear, hear). He did not think that it required much organisation to stimulate or develop Irish nationality (applause). There was no more national people in the world than the Irish. There was a time when Scotland was engaged in what some people called a rebellion, and by others as a noble struggle for their liberties, and which he would not characterise at all, but England on that occasion put forth every effort to develop national sentiment, and the result was that the Scotch were a loyal, prosperous, and wealthy people. Let them try a little of the same medicine in Ireland. They could not play a national air on Patrick's Day without being sent to jail for six months (hisses, and loud cries of "Hear, hear"). He did not want separation from England (hear, hear). They in Ireland could not go themselves. They had not developed their resources, and they must cast in their lot with England, and they had a right to manage their own affairs in a native parliament (cheers).</p>
