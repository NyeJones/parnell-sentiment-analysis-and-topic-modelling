         <p>I have told you that I did not know of Mr Lynch's claims, and having recommended him (Captain O'Shea) in my position, I was bound not to recede one hair's breadth, one jot, but carry through that recommendation to the bitter end, and to test whether the people of Galway and the people of Ireland had confidence in me, which I believe they have, and which the result of this election will show that they have renewed. I have never led during eleven long years, since my entry into public life, I have never led the Irish people astray. I have never led them into any crooked path. I have never led the Irish party astray. When courage was required, when it was necessary for the interests of the nation, I have shown it; and when moderation was required, when moderation was necessary, and temperate judgement for the interests of the nation, I had courage to show it, and I never will lead the party or the nation astray until we have gained for you the right to lead yourselves.</p>
