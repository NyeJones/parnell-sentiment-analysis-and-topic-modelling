         <p>MR. PARNELL said, the hon. Member for Louth was much indebted to the Prime Minister for the courteous manner in which he had spoken of him; but the complaint of his hon. Friend was not the way in which he himself had been treated, but that the Irish Members should be deprived of Tuesday next for the discussion of an important question affecting the interests of Ireland. There were many Irish Members who believed that the House of Commons could never effectually legislate for Ireland, and the hon. and learned Member for Limerick had put a Motion on the Paper directly raising that question. It was now proposed, at a time when there were very few Irish Members present, that another course be taken, which would prevent that Motion from being brought forward. The Notice of the Government was for the Evening Sitting, and several Irish Members were prepared to speak upon it. They were not, however, present now, and were unprepared for this change in the Government arrangements. He would appeal to the Government to allow the matter to stand over until those Irish Members could be present who were able and willing to speak on the subject. If not, then let the Irish Members have Tuesday next.</p>
