         <p>After a division, in which the amendment to Clause 2 of the bill was negatived by a large majority,</p>
         <p>At a quarter past twelve,</p>
         <p>Mr. Parnell rose to move to report progress, and was greeted with ironical cheers and groans. He said, notwithstanding that on a similar motion the other evening hon. members opposite had wasted two valuable hours (cries of "oh" and groans, after which the hon. member attempted to repeat the words six or seven times, and provoked a similar demonstration at each attempt), and notwithstanding the interest taken in the measure he must move to report progress.</p>
         <p>The Home Secretary appealed to hon. members to allow the clause to be passed first.</p>
         <p>Mr. Parnell challenged a division amid groans, but when the division was called be omitted to name a teller and the motion fell to the ground. He and Captain Nolan, however, challenged a division on the question that the clause stand part of the bill. They were in a minority of 9, the majority being 255.</p>
         <p>Mr. Callan impugned the ruling of the chairman, and said that on the motion to report progress on a previous occasion the chairman did not take heed of the challenge of the hon. member for Meath. He deliberately challenged the ruling of the chairman (oh, oh), and he appealed to the hon. member for Meath to confirm him.</p>
         <p>Mr. Parnell - I should not be in the least afraid to impugn your ruling, but on this occasion I have nobody to find fault with but myself. I challenged your ruling or your voice, but I admit I did not attend sufficiently to your challenge. No doubt hon. gentlemen have enjoyed their dinner (oh).</p>
         <p>...</p>
         <p>Mr. Callan tendered a personal explanation. He made his statement on the authority of the member for Meath (loud laughter), and he was glad that the hon. member had withdrawn publicly the impression he conveyed in private (much laughter).</p>
         <p>Mr. Parnell rose and said - The hon. member for Dundalk had misunderstood him (laugher). The hon. member went on amidst great interruptions to address the house. Although he raised his voice to a great pitch scarcely a single intelligible reached the gallery.</p>
