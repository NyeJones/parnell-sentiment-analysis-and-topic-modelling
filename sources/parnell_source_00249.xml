         <p>In pursuance of the arrangement effected yesterday by which Mr M A Lynch was induced to retire from the candidature for the city of Galway Mr Parnell to-day personally canvassed several districts in the constituency in favour of the candidature of Captain W H O'Shea, whom he had nominated for the vacancy. Mr Parnell drove out during the forenoon through the Liberties of Galway district lying outside the city boundaries, but which are included in the electoral area of the borough. In addressing a small gathering of the electors at Castlebar [sic] Mr Parnell explained the circumstances which led to the adoption of the candidature of Captain O'Shea in ignorance of the fact that Mr Lynch entertained any serious intention of coming forward, and stated that he would only have been too happy to have accepted the latter had he known sooner of his willingness to stand. He expressed the hope that he would be able to welcome Mr Lynch as a colleague at a future, and not remote, occasion, and in fact he promised that he should have the next vacancy in the ranks of the Irish Parliamentary Party. Mr Parnell dwelt upon the services of Captain O'Shea in supporting him at a time when the Irish leadership was in question, and urged that under the circumstances he could not throw him over when Mr Lynch definitely came forward. Mr Parnell's remarks were received with favour by his audience, and at Barna, a small hamlet on the shores of Galway Bay, where he spoke to a small gathering of the electors on the same subject, he was also well received.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon, according to promise, Mr Parnell addressed a gathering of the electors in Eyre Square, opposite the Railway Hotel, from the steps of which he spoke...</p>
         <p>Mr Parnell, who was received with loud cheers, said - Fellow-countrymen, I feel very proud and very happy in being able to address so magnificent and vast meeting of the people of Galway, but the circumstances under which this meeting has been called gave me greater encouragement and greater hope than any that I have ever felt since I first entered into public life (cheers). The circumstances of the present contest have been well calculated to try your devotion and your spirit of union - (hear, hear) - and it is a very remarkable fact, indeed, that you should have stood the test. It is a very remarkable fact. I do not care to go into what has taken place during the last few days in your town, and I say that under these circumstances, in view of the events which have happened and of the speeches which have been made in this town during the last few days, it is the most remarkable fact in Irish history that the unity of our cause has been maintained (cheers). And now I wish to say a word or two with regard to the candidature of Mr Lynch, now withdrawn. I admire the spirit and I appreciate the spirit with which he entered into this candidature, and I equally admire the spirit and the feeling and the temper he has exhibited in withdrawing his candidature. Had I known a few days sooner of Mr Lynch's desire to represent this constituency I would have cheerfully yielded to that desire. Had I not, on the contrary, been expressly informed that he would not on any account consent to come forward for this constituency, Mr Lynch would have been your chosen man and to-morrow he would have been my comrade [hear]. But Mr Lynch was not willing at that time, when my duty required me to make that consideration to the constituency - he was not willing to come forward, and I was obliged to look forward to some person outside the people of Galway to whom to give my recommendation, and in that search of all the names of the gentlemen who were suggested to me - af all the names which occurred to my own mind, I came to the conclusion carefully, and after full consideration, that the name of Captain O'Shea (cheers, mingled with a few groans ) was the proper name to suggest for your consideration (hear, hear). After that conclusion was formed, and after my recommendation had been made, my conclusion was fixed. Mr. Lynch has retired, and the history of this contest is a closed book to my mind. Let me now say a word as to the merits of your candidate - of the man who will be your member to-morrow night. I wish to speak also of his demerits and the fault I have had to find with him. I shall be perfectly open in dealing with this question. Mr O'Shea was returned for the county Clare in 1880, not as a member of my party. He was returned unpledged to me, but so far as I know he has fully kept the pledges which he gave the people of Clare in 1880. Immediately after his return a meeting was held in the City Hall in Dublin of the newly-elected Irish members for the purpose of choosing a chairman. I was nominated, and was proposed as chairman and leader of the party. Mr. Wm. Shaw was also proposed. Twenty members of the party voted for Mr Wm. Shaw, and twenty-two members voted for me. Mr O'Shea was one of the twenty-two members who voted for me against Mr Shaw (hear, hear). If Mr. O'Shea and one other member had voted for Mr. Shaw, and not for me, I should never have been the leader of the Irish party, and many proud things which have been done for Ireland could not have been accomplished. I am examining Mr O'Shea's public conduct and public records step by step; and, so far as I have gone, I ask, would it not have been very unfair if I had left Captain O'Shea out of the party, since he voted for me then (hear, hear)? But an isolated act as that was would not in itself have been sufficient to give him a claim on me apart from any other consideration. As far as I know, his votes have been irreproachable. I have been obliged to condemn him publicly, because during the last Parliament he refused to sit in opposition with the members of the Irish party. That is the only fault that I have been able to find with his public conduct. He refused to sit in opposition, but I considered that that was a fatal fault - a fatal blemish - and I repeatedly told him in the last Parliament that unless he could see his way to sit on our side of the house I should not recommend him to the constituency of Clare, and he was not returned to Parliament, although I supported him in Liverpool for a seat which we could not carry ourselves, and to which I considered he had first claim; but since this election commenced, Mr O'Shea' has given me a promise that he will sit on our side of the house; and, therefore, my last objection to him has disappeared (cheers). Under these circumstances should I allow him to be persecuted and kept out of Parliament. I know that his return cannot be any injury to the Irish party. He was the best man that I knew of at the time that I recommended him, as I already told you. I did not know of Mr Lynch's claims, and having recommended him I was in my position bound not to recede one hair's breadth - not one jot (hear, hear), but to carry through the recommendation to the bitter end, and to test whether the people of Galway and the people of Ireland had the confidence in me which I believe they have, and which I believe the result of to-day's election will show that during my eleven years since my entering into public life I have never led the Irish people astray, never led them into any crooked paths; when courage was required and was necessary for the interests of the Irish nation I have shown it (hear, hear); and when moderation was necessary, and where temperate judgment for the nation was necessary, I have had the courage to show it, and I shall never lead the party or the nation astray until we have gained for you the right to lead and govern yourselves (cheers). Now fellow-countrymen there are several gentlemen here who desire to address you. I think I have said everything that it was necessary for me to say with regard to the candidature of Mr O'Shea. I need only add this, that you must not think that because Mr Lynch has retired it is not necessary for you to go to the poll to-morrow and vote. You, all of you, must go and vote for Mr O'Shea, for otherwise the Tories might take advantage of the situation, and might go and poll for Mr Lynch in order, if possible to run him close to the poll for Mr O'Shea. This is not Mr Lynch's fault. Mr Lynch has acted honourably towards me and towards the party. His name cannot now be withdrawn from the paper, it must be on the ballot paper, and therefore the Tories have the opportunity of playing this dirty trick. But you will defeat this dirty trick, and you will give your vote, not for Mr Lynch, but for O'Shea, for the purpose of showing that you have voted for me and for Ireland (cheers). I should have desired to have addressed you also, apart from this election, upon the question of the day, but I think that, in view of the fact that Father Sheehy is here and will address you, I shall not longer detain you. I will only add, in conclusion, my conviction that the day is very near at hand when we shall have gained for Ireland the right to make her own laws on Irish soil [cheers]. When that day comes I shall regard my mission as fulfilled. I have not entered on this great struggle with any motives of personal ambition; but it is my duty to stand by you till these measures are gained for you. I have come down to Galway to stand by you in your cause, for any appearance of division in our party, in the weakening of my authority, would have been fatal to the cause, and that is the reason why I am here, and I confidently leave the result in your hands. After many a month you will look back to the proceedings of this day with satisfaction for the results, which have proved that you have to-day struck a great and successful blow for Ireland (loud applause).</p>
         <p>...</p>
         <p>The Dublin Express [italics] says there is still some spark of manly spirit left in the breasts of Irish patriots, and though trampled on will turn up anew. Mr Parnell's arbitrary power will not long bear the strain he has put on it.</p>
