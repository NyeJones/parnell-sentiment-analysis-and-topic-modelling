         <p>MR. PARNELL regretted that no Member of the Government had offered any explanation as to those alleged sales of condemned provisions by the Admiralty, and their subsequent purchase as food for use on board merchant ships. The hon. Member for Plymouth (Mr. Bates), by saying that he never purchased any for his ships, thereby expressed his condemnation of them. Their description as articles whose term of guarantee had expired, would not render them any more palatable to the crews that had to eat them. If such food was not fit for consumption in the Navy, the Admiralty ought to consider that it was not fit for consumption in the merchant service or elsewhere. These provisions were often consumed by men 2,000 miles from land, and they had no opportunity of bringing the culprits—for they were nothing less—before the sanitary authority. A tradesman who sold articles unfit for the food of man was fined, and in some cases sent to prison for so doing; but he supposed a right hon. Gentleman would hardly be sent to prison for doing such an act.</p>
         <p>...</p>
         <p>MR. PARNELL said, that with all due respect he thought they were. It could not be denied that in selling these stores the Government sold articles unfit for human food. He certainly did expect that the President of the Board of Trade would have taken notice of the point raised by the hon. Member for Derby (Mr. Plimsoll).</p>
