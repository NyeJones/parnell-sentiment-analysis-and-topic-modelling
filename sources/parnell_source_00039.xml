         <p>MR. PARNELL asked the Secretary of State for War, Whether the Under Secretary of State for War, in reply to a Memorial from the Catholic Union of Ireland, relative to the attendance of Catholic Soldiers at Mass on certain specified days, stated that the Right honourable Gentleman had no objection to officers commanding giving facilities to the troops of any denomination to attend Divine Service if asked to do so by their clergy, but that he did not consider that commanding officers should take the initiative in such a matter; whether the case of those men of the Meath Militia quartered in barracks, who were confined to barracks during the hours of one Divine Service, and engaged in the usual parades during the hours of the other Divine Services, of the denomination to which they belonged, after a request had been made by the Chaplain that they might be allowed to attend one service, is contrary to the intention of the Eight honourable Gentleman as conveyed in the above-mentioned reply; and, whether the Eight honourable Gentleman would think it expedient to draw the attention of officers commanding Irish Militia regiments to that mentioned reply in order to prevent future misunderstanding?</p>
