         <p>It is difficult to overstate the regret every reasonable man must feel at the demonstration of character which followed Mr. Disraeli's reply to Mr. Brooks yesterday on the subject of the Fenian prisoners... But it was made the excuse for a succession of short speeches from members from Ireland, each one of which was an injury to the inhabitants of Ireland. If the Irish members would but remember how they wound their mother country by these displays!...</p>
         <p>... Mr. O'Connor Power began badly, but Mr. Biggar and Mr. Parnell went beyond him. We decline to reproduce Mr. Biggar's vulgarity, which appears to be peculiar to himself, and was repudiated by Mr. Brooks, for himself and other members. As for Mr. Parnell, he called attention to the fact that one of the two prisoners convicted of a Fenian offence was an Irishman and had been sentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude, and the other was an Englishman and had been sentenced to seven years'; and he held it not improbable that the first was doubly punished because he was an Irishman and had excited the prejudices of an English Judge. Few insinuations could be more offensive, but we must take it in connexion with other portions of this young member's speech. Referring to the two men who had been convicted of complicity in the Manchester murder, he gravely assured the House, on the strength of a book published by the United States Government, that there was no evidence at all against one of them, and he regretted the absence of Mr. Moore, the member for Tipperary, because that gentleman believes in his heart that neither of these convicts was guilty of the crime of which they had been convicted. The extravagance of these remarks leads us to believe that there is, perhaps, no malignity in Mr. Parnell's imputations on the conduct of the Judicial Bench.</p>
