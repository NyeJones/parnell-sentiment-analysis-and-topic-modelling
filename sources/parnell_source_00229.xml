         <p>Mr. Parnell - The right hon. gentleman has spoken of two men who were said to have been guilty of murder. With regard to the Manchester affair, I hold in my hand a book called "The Rules for American Citizens," which can be seen by any member; it was ordered by the United States Congress as a return. It gives a report of the trial of Condon and Mulady at Manchester. If any hon. member will take the trouble to read the evidence - if the right hon. gentleman himself will take the trouble to read this book - he will see that the evidence against Condon is given in full, and he will find that there is not a particle of evidence to connect him with that murder (hear, hear). As regards Mulady, he was a prisoner taken up afterwards in London. He was taken on the statement of a workman. He was a young man of 17, and there are many men who know that Mulady was no more at Manchester on the day of that business that I was (a laugh). He was put on his trial and found guilty of murder, and sentenced to be hanged, but the sentence was afterwards commuted to penal servitude for life. I am sorry that the junior member for Tipperary is not in his place to-night to stand up and say he believes that Condon is perfectly innocent of the crime of killing Sergeant Brett at Manchester. With regard to the military prisoners who are confined in Australia, I think the right hon. gentleman is under a misapprehension when he represents to this house that they are in better position in Australia than they would be in this country. I remember that the late Mr. Ronayne, before he left London to go to Cork - and he was a man with special information on this subject - told me it was supposed that the convict establishments in Western Australia were about to be given up, and, as a consequence, the prisoners, if not released, would be sent to penal servitude in England, so that it will be additionally hard to these men, who have been enjoying some absence from penal servitude, should they be brought back and put in such convict prisons as Chatham or Dartmoor, and subjected to the rigour of English penal servitude. I throw out these hints in order that the right hon. gentleman may inquire into the matter. With regard to the three prisoners who are now in prison in England. McCarthy is a brave soldier, who had fought, and fought well, for England in many parts of the world. Is it fair, after this man has had ten years in penal servitude - ten years of discipline, which is given in order to effect reformation in the minds of thieves, murderers, and the worst of criminals - is it fair to keep the man in imprisonment any longer? With regard to Davitt, who was sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude by a judge I may say that the man who only got seven years was an Englishman; and I do not know how much effect Davitt's being an Irishman may have had with the judge (no, no). Hon. gentlemen may say "no, no," but it is very hard to be superior to prejudices on all occasions; and I have little doubt when this man was sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude, the fact of his being an Irishman, and the fact of this occurring just after the murder of Sergeant Brett, which created a great deal of feeling in the minds of the middle and upper classes of this country, I have no doubt that fact had an effect.</p>
