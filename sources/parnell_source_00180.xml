         <p>When he got his opportunity, Mr. Parnell, a Home Ruler, got up; but before he had got out a couple of sentences he stumbled into the inevitable theme of the injustice committed by allowing Irish patriots to languish in prison. This reference to the traditional woes of Ireland drew forth protesting cries from the Ministerial side. Mr. Parnell got rather nettled at this, and protested, with an assumption of mock dignity that one hundred Irish Members had been present during the debate, that not one had spoken, and that it was consequently very unfair that he should be cried down almost before he had opened his mouth. By way of taking his revenge he said he would reserve his remarks till a future occasion, and moved the adjournment of the debate. Mr. Butt made a paternal appeal to his unruly follower not to persist in his intention; but Mr. Parnell broke away from his leader and persisted in his course. Upon the motion being put from the chair, Mr. Parnell's motion was agreed to without a division, and the debate was indefinitely adjourned. Oddly enough, Mr. Parnell effected the very thing which leaders on both sides desired - he got the question shelved without a division.</p>
