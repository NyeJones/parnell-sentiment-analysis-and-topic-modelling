         <p>Mr Parnell, MP, in moving the admission of two new members, said Sir Michael Hicks-Beech was obliged to run to Belfast to find an audience that would listen to him for he could not find one in Dublin (applause) to listen to the chosen British statesman abusing seven-eights of the people of this country. Abuse was a very poor argument and it was a very poor argument and it was a great pity there were no more Belfasts in this country, where Sir Michael Hicks Beach might be allowed to go about and give these lessons for it was lessons to them. He thought the Chief Secretary's reference to Irelands [sic] opportunity was an admission that there was a great weakness somewhere (hear, hear.) Until the Irish people had obtained the right of self Government and had become self-reliant and self-respecting, let England go to war with no foreign nation; let her enter into no alliance, defensive or offensive; let her not guarantee or back-up rotten Powers like Egypt (applause.) England had to look to herself. He was sorry to say this, but it was necessary to speak plainly. Let them look abroad and see the horizon which might at any moment burst into flames of war, and then England would wish that she had settled their grievances first (applaase [sic]). Let her have in the strong arms and true hearts of the Irish people her best defence; without them she was defenceless. Her money would not buy her safety, Ireland would not always miscalculate her own strength, but she was determined constitutionally, while she can, to work out her own future and her own safety.</p>
