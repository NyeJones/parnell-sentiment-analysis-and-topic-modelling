         <p>Mr. Parnell, referring to the prisoners who were tried at Manchester, said there was evidence given at the trial to connect Condon with the murder; while Maloney, a lad of 17 or 18, who was arrested in London some time after the sentence of the three men at Manchester, had really nothing to do with the attack on the police van at Manchester, and was taken up merely on his own foolish boast to a fellow-workman that he had been present at that attack. He regretted that the junior member for Tipperary (Mr. Stephen Moore), who believed in his heart that neither Condon nor Maloney was guilty of that affair, was not now in the House. With regard to the prisoners who had been enjoying the partial absence of prison restraints in Australia, it would be a great hardship to be brought back to Dartmoor or Chatham and subjected to all the rigour of an English convict establishment. He hoped, therefore, that the Prime Minister would inquire into that matter. The man McCarthy, now in prison in England, was a brave soldier, who had served his country; and it was unfair, after he had been 10 years in penal servitude, to keep him incarcerated any longer. Davitt, who was sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude, was an Irishman, and Wilson, who was an Englishman got only seven years. He feared that Davitt's nationality had operated to his prejudice.</p>
