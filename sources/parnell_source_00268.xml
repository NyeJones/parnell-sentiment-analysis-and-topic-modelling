         <p>Mr. Parnell, who was received with loud cheers from the Irish members, congratulated Mr. Trevelyan on having, like the French General who had unsuccessfully defended Paris on his own plan - a plan, however, which did not seem to awaken much enthusiasm in the House. The right hon. gentleman had stated why he had left the Government, but not why he had resigned his post as Chief Secretary. (Hear, hear, from the Irish benches.) The right hon. gentleman went on to justify his past utterances and action which had been impugned by Mr. Trevelyan. Speaking of America and the assassination literature which came from that country. Mr. Parnell asserted that it was not Irish literature, and further stted [sic] that the Irish Parliamentary party received the support, not only of the Irish people in the United States, but was also approved of by the bulk of the native Americans, who had hailed with satisfaction the promised measure of the Prime Minister in affording the prospect of a settlement of the Irish difficulty. Mr. Trevelyan had condemned the proposal about to be brought forward by the Government for buying out the Irish landlords, but he omitted to state that when he was Irish Secretary he had actually brought in a bill that would have led to the expenditure of a large sum of money for buying out the landlords in Ireland. As to the Bill before the House, while reserving his further expression of opinion until he had seen the bill in print, Mr. Parnell congratulated the House on the fact that there was still living an English statesman, who could devote his attention to this important matter, and begged to thank the right hon. gentleman for what would not only prove a beneficial measure from the Irish point of view, but which he (Mr. Parnell) believed would be found to be of equal benefit to England. The bill, nevertheless, contained blots, which the Irish representatives would do their best to remove. One of these was to be found in the financial proposals of the bill, which he regards as very unfavourable to Ireland, especially in regard to the Irish tribute to the Imperial exchequer. The hon. gentleman also complained of the proposition as to the orders - two orders - intended to constitute the Irish Parliament, on the ground that the first order, consisting of peers not subject to the influence of the popular vote, would have the power of hanging up measures demanded by the people and their representatives for two or three year. On the whole, however, apart from these defects, he believed the measure would be cheerfully accepted by the Irish people and their representatives as a satisfactory solution of the long standing dispute between the two countries, and tending to prosperity and peace in Ireland and satisfaction in England. (Cheers.)</p>
