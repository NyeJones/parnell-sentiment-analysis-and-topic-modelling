         <p>The chairman said it was a very painful matter they had met to discuss, and they must all feel the responsibility that devolved upon them. They should consider the matter with every desire to do Mr Smyth justice between man and man. In recent years Mr Smyth had appeared to deviate from the course he ought to have followed, and many of them were inclined to make excuses for him, but his course in the past few weeks has changed. He (Mr. Parnell) could not imagine how any man could be carried away to join such a clique. He did not believe Mr. Smyth had any political sympathy with the men with whom Mr. Smyth was joined. He did not believe Mr. Smyth belonged to the Whig faction that sought to get possession of the City of Dublin last week, and not only of the City of Dublin, but sought to debase the national party. (Applause).</p>
         <p>...</p>
         <p>The Chairman suggested the words that Mr Smyth should consider himself expelled from the association if he did not apologise ought to be omitted. (No.)</p>
