         <p>Mr Parnell then proposed some new members, and in the course of his remarks congratulated the League on the importance which its weekly meetings were acquiring - (applause) - and their influence in informing the people of both countries of the extent of some of the grievances under which Ireland laboured, and as showing the English nation at least that there was a defect somewhere. (Applause.) He then alluded to the recent purchase of the Suez Canal Shares by the Minister, and said that if the English people would but open their eyes they would see that amidst the gathering complications which threatened at any moment to burst into flames of war upon the horizon, it would be their interest to treat Ireland with fair play, and allow her the self government which she was entitled to, which she asked, aye, and which she was determined to have. (Applause.) Until that day came when it was conceded, let England enter into no foreign alliances, offensive or defensive, and have no backing up of rotten Powers like Egypt. (Applause.) He was sorry to say this, but it was better to speak plainly after the plain speaking at Belfast the other day. (Hear.) Indeed, it was a pity there were no a great many more Belfasts in the country, to which Sir Michael Beach could go round giving his lectures like a stage manager. (Laughter.) It was better to tell England that she ought to settle the grievances which existed at home before she took up the settlement of grievances abroad, for if she did not try to find in the hearts of the Irish people one of her best defences, she might find herself defenceless. (Applause.)</p>
