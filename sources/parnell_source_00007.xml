         <p>Mr C.S. Parnell, on coming forward to second the motion, was received with loud applause. He said he was glad to have the opportunity of seconding the names of such men as he saw in that list as members of the Home Rule League. There were men of every occupation, rank, and position in life, who were going to be their helpers and coadjutors in carrying out the good work they were all engaged in and bound to see accomplished (hear, hear, and applause), so that he thought the Home Rule programme answered the purpose of developing the nationality of the country (hear, hear). He could not help thinking that their lot was cast in with England, and if they were permitted to manage their own affairs they would attain all the prosperity the country required (hear, hear, and applause).</p>
