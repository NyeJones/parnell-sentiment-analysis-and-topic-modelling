         <p>Mr. Parnell, after some observations in reference to the past Government of Ireland and its abuses, thus referred to Mr. Gladstone's scheme:- "It is difficult to express a definite or positive opinion with regard to the bill before it has been printed, and I should like to reserve a too-positive expression of opinion until I have seen the measure, which, I suppose, will be issued on Monday; but still I think it is right that I should say something about its merits as they have been explained to us by the right hon. gentleman, the member for Midlothian. Allow me to say, sir, that I think it will prove to be a happy and fortunate thing both for Ireland and England that there was one man living, an English statesman, with great power and extraordinary ability of the right hon. gentleman to lend his voice to poor helpless Ireland on this question (loud Irish cheers). He has devoted his great mind, his extraordinary energy to the unravelling of this question. It seems to many people that the task may be too large, too terrible even for the right hon. gentleman. I believe it will not be so (Home Rule cheers). But whatever may be the fate of the measure I believe the cause of Ireland, of Irish autonomy, will gain enormously in a way it never could have otherwise gained by the genius of the right hon. gentleman. (Home Rule cheers.) He has drafted his bill and explained it in a speech which, from anyone else, might have been called extraordinary. To none of the sons of Ireland at any time has ever been given the genius and talent of the right hon. gentleman; certainly nothing approaching it in these days. I thank him, therefore, for the energy and the time he has devoted to this matter; and I believe sincerely in my heart that the result will be that the people of England will recognise, as the result of what he has done, that he has been to them, no less than to the people of Ireland a National benefactor (cheers). But there are undoubtedly great faults and blots in the measure. The right hon. gentleman has had to meet very severe criticism and a very extraordinary state of affairs. He has seen his officers leaving his side one by one and drawing their swords on him as the member for the Border Burghs has done to-night. He has had I suppose to shape his measure to meet the tremendous opposition worked against it; but there are several points it will be our duty when the measure reaches its committee stage to oppose very strongly, and to press for serious modification and amendment. The question of the customs has been touched on. In giving up the customs, that would practically mean giving up to you the control of seven-eighths or three fourths of the revenue of Ireland. It would be absolutely as much in your power as it is now, both in regard to the original assignment of the taxes and the receiving of the money. The right hon. gentleman has indeed explained that if we were to insist on a separate custom house that England could deprive Ireland, by collecting in Ireland the duties on whiskey and tobacco, of £1,400,000 a year. This would be a serious matter, and it may be fairly balanced against the control of the customs and the excise. But if the Prime Minister is to claim credit for giving us £1,400.00 in lieu of the retention of the customs within the Imperial authority, he cannot claim credit for it over again, and make us pay out of that £1,000,000 a year for the Irish Constabulary, over whom we are to have no control whatever, at all events for the present. Then there is the question of contribution to the Imperial Exchequer. I cannot admit - and I say it with great deference - I cannot admit either the justice or the liberality of the standard of comparison the right hon. gentleman has taken. This is the most unfavourable standard to us that the right hon. gentleman could have chosen. Of course he is anxious to make the best bargain he can for England, and to secure as large a contribution for the Imperial Treasury as is possible, but he should remember that Ireland is a very poor country, and that with such a small balance as he shows of about £400,000 a year, it will be absolutely impossible for Ireland to have any credit in the direction of floating loans. Now we are able to borrow from the Treasury large sums of money for various purposes in Ireland. Irish landlords, Irish tenants, local authorities can borrow money. All these are very important matters, but we shall have to surrender them under the scheme of the right hon. gentleman, and we shall be left with a budget which will exceed the annual balance by about £400,000 a year, and a budget arrived at on an estimate which necessitates that the consumption of spirits not only in Ireland, but also in England, should continue at its present rate, and that the duty should be kept as now, as I suppose it will be. It is scarcely fair to press us too closely or to insist upon too hard or too close a bargain in regard to this matter. Of course whatever the sum agreed upon is we must pay it, and we will pay it (hear). But it would be most unfortunate if the result of such a standard of comparison as the right hon. gentleman has selected should be to impoverish the Irish Exchequer. In that case only would there be any possibility of the danger which the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Trevelyan) has conjured up with regard to an attempted repudiation of the Imperial debt, an attempt which if made would be entirely unsuccessful, because you would have the collection of the Excise absolutely in your own hands. When you are proposing a great settlement which undoubtedly can only succeed if it is cheerfully accepted by public opinion in Ireland if all its important provisions are recognised as just and equitable, is it worth while, on the part of a rich country like England, to drive too hard a bargain? I am convinced that we have a much stronger case for the adoption of a standard of 1-20th or 1-22nd as the relative wealth of the two countries than the right hon. gentleman has for adopting the very unfavourable standard of 1-15th. I have every confidence that when the time comes in committee, and when we put our case regarding this most important financial question, that the consciences not only of the House of Commons, but also of the right hon. gentleman the Prime Minister, will be touched in this matter, and that his zeal for making a good bargain for his own country in the question of Imperial contribution has led him into doing an unintentional injustice to Ireland. Then, again, I think that the question of the Royal Irish Constabulary has been left in a most unsatisfactory state. It is unfair to ask us to pay for a force, or a large proportion of a force, over which we shall have no control whatever. But some light might be thrown upon that by a perusal of the bill itself when issued, and by proceedings in committee (hear, hear). Then comes the vote by orders that had been explained by the right hon. gentleman to be that it gave the first order - the twenty eight peers - the right to hang up any bill for three years, three years or a dissolution, whichever was the longer. Thus it would be absolutely within the power of the first order to hang up any measure it pleased, and so bring the whole proceedings of the Legislature to a deadlock. This is a very important point, and I say that I have strongly insisted upon such a proportional representation of the Protestant minority as would give them representation according to their numerical strength, and as far as the first order was concerned it might be very well, with a view to preventing any rash, hasty, ill-considered legislation, and with that I cordially agree (hear, hear); but, so far as it acts or could be made to act as an obstruction to legislation, or as a means of bringing about a political deadlock on the part of a body of members who could scarcely be said to be representative, I think it should be moderated so as to make it impossible (hear, hear). As regards the measure itself, the Prime Minister has truly said that it ought not to proceed unless it is cheerfully welcomed, not only by the Irish members, but the Irish people. I quite agree with that. I am convinced that if our views are fairly met in committee with regard to the defects to which I have alluded that the effects of its working will be to agreeably disappoint the right hon. member for the Border Burghs, and that this proposal will be cheerfully accepted by the Irish people and by Ireland's representatives as a solution of the long standing dispute between the two countries, and that it will be to the prosperity and peace of Ireland, and to the satisfaction of England (cheers).</p>
