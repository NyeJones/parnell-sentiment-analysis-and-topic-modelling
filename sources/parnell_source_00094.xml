         <p>Mr. Parnell, M.P., who was warmly received, also addressed the meeting, and in doing so, paid a high compliment to the to the genius and talents with which Mr. Butt direction the action of the Irish Home Rule members - especially the less experienced ones in Parliament. He so guided them that he many times turned a point, that would have proved a defeat to their side, into a triumph for their cause. He had saved him (Mr. Parnell) once, and he knew how good it was to have somebody to stand by and direct when he wanted to do something (laughter). He referred to the efforts of Mr. Butt in reviving a movement which had perished with Lucas and Gavan Duffy, and by the treachery of Sadleir and Keogh and which was now being tried again. A few years ago, Mr. Butt asked a few friends to join him. He knew the time to push Ireland to the front. Now, what did they see? They had sixty representatives in England trying to convert the prejudices of the English nation. They would do so if they could, and if they could not they were not ashamed of defeat. England must admit that she was not able to govern Ireland after her seven centuries of misgovernment, and she ought to be obliged to them for pointing out how instead of being England's danger, Ireland might become her strength. Their hand was now stretched out, and let England take it ere it was too late. After alluding in feeling to the terms of the memory of the late John Martin, he resumed his seat amid enthusiastic applause.</p>
