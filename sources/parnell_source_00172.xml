         <p>Mr. Parnell called the attention of the house to the appointment of a petty sessional clerk in Meath. He had taken the opportunity of asking on Friday why Mr. Darling had been appointed over the head of Mr. Sheridan, who had received a majority of magisterial votes. The Chief Secretary had stated that the reason why the Castle had appointed Mr. Darling was that three of the magistrates who voted for Mr. Sheridan were not qualified to vote. It appeared that one of the votes was given by the stipendiary magistrate, and he thought it much to be regretted that stipendiary magistrates should mix themselves up with the partisan contests of local magistrates. At the same time he believed there was an Act of Parliament giving the Castle power to appoint a clerk, the appointment being specially reserved to the magistrates, though the Castle might, in conjunction with the magistrates, dismiss a collector. A great hardship had been done to Mr. Sheridan and a slight upon the people of Meath. The fact was that the question of religion was carried too much into these local appointments (hear, hear). Of all the cess collectors in Meath county only one was a Catholic, and it had been the constant practice in that county for magistrates and the Castle to reserve every single appointment they could possibly get for providing for Protestants and men of their own clique (hear, hear). It was to be regretted that the underlings of Dublin Castle should have allowed themselves to be influenced by underhand representations to appoint a man who had not been duly elected and annul the appointment of one who had been duly elected (hear, hear). He moved the rejection of the votes (cheers).</p>
